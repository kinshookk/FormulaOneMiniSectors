Formula 1 Qualifying Analysis: Visualize and analyze the qualifying session between the pole sitter and P2 driver in Formula 1. This tool uses FastF1, Streamlit, and Matplotlib to compare sector speeds and provide insights into the fastest driver per minisector.


# Formula 1 Qualifying Analysis

This project provides a detailed analysis and visualization of Formula 1 qualifying sessions, allowing for a comparison of the pole position lap with that of the P2 driver. Built with FastF1, Streamlit, and Matplotlib, the tool highlights which driver was faster in each minisector, providing insights into the most competitive areas of the track.

## Features

- **Minisector Analysis**: Divide the track into customizable minisectors and identify the faster driver in each.
- **Lap Time Comparison**: Display lap times and deltas between P1 and P2.
- **Track Visualization**: Visualize the track with colored segments representing the faster driver in each minisector.
- **Directional Indicator**: Adds a track direction arrow for enhanced readability.

## Dependencies

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the web interface
- [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) for F1 data access
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation
